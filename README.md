# js-challenges

This repository contains various coding challenges that you will find on the [JavaScript Today Blog](https://blog.javascripttoday.com). 

We want you try them for yourself before looking at the solutions we provide in the articles, hence this repository. Each challenge will contain its own test file, to make things a bit more guided as you work through the problems.

*** 

If you have an idea for a challenge and would like to create one, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
