# js-challenges

This repository contains various coding challenges that you will find on the [JavaScript Today Blog](https://blog.javascripttoday.com). 

We want you try them for yourself before looking at the solutions we provide in the articles, hence this repository. Each challenge will contain its own test file, to make things a bit more guided as you work through the problems.

To start the tests, run the following command:

```bash
npx jest collatz/test.js --watch
```

**Note**: The first time you run Jest with npx it will prompt you to ask if its okay to install the package. This is not a global or local install, it is referring to installing to the npm cache.

If you have an idea for a challenge and would like to create one, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
